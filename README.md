# AdMania

A personal project, android game, the project is still ongoing.

The main idea of this game is to make ads more atractive to the player by integrating them in the game as a core mechanic.

The watch ads mechanic is simple, after each video add or interactive add there would be a small survey about the contents of the advertisment, thus insuring attention and rewarding the player not for watching an add but for enganging in it. The more accurate the player finishes the very quick and light survey after the advertisment, the more rewards he would get.

It's a tycoon game where the player runs an advertisment company, similar to GameDev Tycoon
